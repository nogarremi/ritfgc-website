							<h2>Max Smith, President</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Mechatronics Engineering Technology Major</p>
							<p>Hi, my name is Max but you can call me bestbyak, every1 does. Jokes aside, I’ve been a big fan of fighting games for a long time. I would always watch them but never really played, as none of my friends liked them. When I came to RIT and saw the FGC club I knew it was the place for me, I’ve started playing the games I used to only watch and it has been a blast. Everyone here was incredibly friendly and welcoming to me, so my goal isn’t to make it what I already know it is; instead, my goal is to keep the club as amazing as it was when I joined and do my best to elevate it.</p>

							<h2>Caleb Coplan, Vice President</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Computer Engineering Major</p>
							<p>In 2021, I was roped into buying Guilty Gear -STRIVE- on release by a couple of friends and I was hooked instantly. I was then subsequently pulled along to play at a local event in my hometown. Although fighting games are fun, what really sold it to me was the community. It made me think fighting games are something I can spend the rest of my life playing. You see, I believe in the life-changing, transformative power of getting punked by the same guy at your local every week. As an advocate for both low-tier and weird characters, the greatest thrill to me is overcoming whatever may be in your way, and doing it your way. No matter if you like throwing with Bottom 1 like me, or if you don’t hate yourself and pick a viable character. It’s my goal to maintain that environment of friendly competition that I love. </p>

							<h2>Jay Wong, Treasurer</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Game Design & Development Major</p>
							<p>I came to RIT as a big Smash Bros player and while I had played some other fighting games casually I rarely ever played anything except Melty Blood. On a whim one day I decided to check out the FGC club and had a blast just playing random different fighting games with everybody else. As an advocate for both low-tier and weird characters, I was never really competitive when it came to fighting games but, after a few weeks at the FGC, I began to enjoy coming back week after week to both play casuals and in brackets. The community here is welcoming for anybody looking to have fun and as an eboard member I hope to help this club prosper and grow for all its past and present members.</p>

							<h2>Ben Krueger Secretary</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Chemical Engineering Major</p>
							<p>I was first introduced to fighting games as a kid after purchasing a copy of Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting from my local game store, and playing it after school with my dad. Our sessions amounted to both of us resorting to button-mashing because I was too stupid to figure out what the big arrow meant when I looked up “Guile moves” on Google. I was enamoured with the concept though, and inevitably went back to this game store to purchase Guilty Gear: The Missing Link, BlazBlue Chronophantasma Extend, and Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[st], which quickly shaped my passion for weird ass anime fighters. Never once did I think buying a game in 2019 would lead to me 5 years later being known as “the Zombie Kagura guy”. Upon first attending RIT FGC, I was pleasantly surprised with how welcoming the community is to the clean and washed alike, as well as how open they were to always try a new game out, even if it was some weird anime shit. As a member of this community, I want nothing more than to help cultivate a space where both new and seasoned players alike feel comfortable showing up and having a good time.</p>

							<h2>Gunnar Dickey, Social Media Manager</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Game Desgin & Development Major</p>
							<p>I got into fighting games a few months after Guilty Gear Strive’s release. I played Strive off and on before coming here, because I didn’t have any friends who played it. When I got here, I found the RITFGC during orientation week and decided to try it out. I managed to do alright in my first bracket, which was nice, but what kept me coming back was how welcoming and friendly the environment had been. I’ve never been much of a social person, but here I felt like I can talk to anyone and have a good time doing it. My favorite part was discovering and trying new games and the feeling of getting better as I learned them. My goal is to keep the club a place where people can enjoy themselves and try new games as well.
