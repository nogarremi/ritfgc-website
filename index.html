							<h2>Gunnar Dickey, President</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Game Desgin & Development Major</p>
							<p>I got into fighting games a few months after Guilty Gear Strive’s release. I played Strive off and on before coming here, because I didn’t have any friends who played it. When I got here, I found the RITFGC during orientation week and decided to try it out. I managed to do alright in my first bracket, which was nice, but what kept me coming back was how welcoming and friendly the environment had been. I’ve never been much of a social person, but here I felt like I can talk to anyone and have a good time doing it. My favorite part was discovering and trying new games and the feeling of getting better as I learned them. My goal is to keep the club a place where people can enjoy themselves and try new games as well.

							<h2>Julian Maxwell, Vice President</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Game Design & Development Major</p>
							<p>I was first introduced to fighting games as a kid after purchasing a copy of Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting from my local game store, and playing it after school with my dad. Our sessions amounted to both of us resorting to button-mashing because I was too stupid to figure out what the big arrow meant when I looked up “Guile moves” on Google. I was enamoured with the concept though, and inevitably went back to this game store to purchase Guilty Gear: The Missing Link, BlazBlue Chronophantasma Extend, and Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[st], which quickly shaped my passion for weird ass anime fighters. Never once did I think buying a game in 2019 would lead to me 5 years later being known as “the Zombie Kagura guy”. Upon first attending RIT FGC, I was pleasantly surprised with how welcoming the community is to the clean and washed alike, as well as how open they were to always try a new game out, even if it was some weird anime shit. As a member of this community, I want nothing more than to help cultivate a space where both new and seasoned players alike feel comfortable showing up and having a good time.</p>

							<h2>Ben Krueger, Treasurer</h2>
							<p>Third Year, Chemical Engineering Major</p>
							<p>I came to RIT as a big Smash Bros player and while I had played some other fighting games casually I rarely ever played anything except Melty Blood. On a whim one day I decided to check out the FGC club and had a blast just playing random different fighting games with everybody else. As an advocate for both low-tier and weird characters, I was never really competitive when it came to fighting games but, after a few weeks at the FGC, I began to enjoy coming back week after week to both play casuals and in brackets. The community here is welcoming for anybody looking to have fun and as an eboard member I hope to help this club prosper and grow for all its past and present members.</p>

							<h2>Willow Peake Secretary</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Robotics and Manufacturing Engineering Technology Major</p>
							<p>I was first introduced to fighting games back in 2021 by my old competitive robotics teammate. I played mostly guilty gear, and eventually dropped the genre all together because very few people I knew in person would play it. Coming to RIT and joining the FGC club reignited my passion for the genre and inspired me to seek out new games and new friends. As a low tier champion, I strive for excellence in all games I play. My favorite games are Under Night In-Birth, Pogostuck, Virtua Tennis, and Ultra Fight Da! Kyanta 2. </p>

							<h2>Emerson Blin Social Media Manager</h2>
							<p>Second Year, Chemistry Major</p>
							<p>I was born at a young age very intrigued towards video games, always trying to get my hands on anything I might find fun and getting the most out of it. It has been a medium I have sunk an immeasurable amount of time into, and a big one of those time sinks has been fighting games. Starting with smash 4, stumbling my way around with a sideways wii remote, I eventually found my way into traditional fighters through Guilty Gear Strive and picking up Faust as my main. Strive has been a super fun game for me and started my streak of trying to find the biggest abomination on any roster and going “That one”. I can only hope that through my time here I can make it as welcoming a place to any that are veterans or are just curious, and I’m always down to try a new game even if I don’t know anything about it, so don’t be afraid to ask and say hi!</p>
